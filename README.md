**single-threading:** : branch where I display a stack blocking example explaining how heavy computation negatively impacts user experience.

**multi-threading:** branch where I solve this stack blocking issue using web workers.

**bonus-example:** Last bonus example taken from the workers [WhatWG specs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html) , where I showcase a background image processor.
